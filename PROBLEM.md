## Problem Statement: List Operations

This exercise should be completed using Test Driven Development Technique

  - Test classes provided in this exercise will show compilation errors, when the exercise is cloned locally
  - Classes and methods should be created by analysing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors
  - Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass 
  - Some of the requirements/hints are mentioned below
  
  ```
   In this problem, fruit names have to searched and sorted from the given input collections containing fruit names and taste of respective fruits 
        
   - Following functionality needs to be implemented
   
        - search a given fruit from the given list of fruits
        - sort the given list of fruits in descending order
        - search the fruit for a given taste from the given collection of fruit names and tastes
   
   - Empty and null inputs should be checked       
   ```

**NOTE: ALL THE METHODS SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED USING STREAMS API ONLY** 
         
## Instructions
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Do not change the provided class/method names unless instructed
